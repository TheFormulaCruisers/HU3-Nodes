### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why


Give an example


### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why


Give an example


## Deployment

You require an SPI cable in order to upload code to the nodes, this takes away the possibility to debug your code. 
Further more there are not enough pins for an LCD display available. 
Luckily we have 4 LEDâ€™s which we can work with and monitor the state of our code and nodes.
